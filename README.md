##### Imperative/Declarative
Imperative approach is giving step by step instruction on how to get to the end state, while declarative approach is just giving the end result and React does all the steps to get there. 

##### Programming Paradigms
Procedural, Functional, Object Oriented, Component Oriented. Even though javascript has callbacks, it is not function because functional programming also has immutable data and a focus on recursion over looping. 

##### Controlled/Uncontrolled Component 
Controlled Component("dumb component"): takes its current value through props and notifies changes through callbacks like onChange. A parent component "controls" it by handling the callback and managing its own state and passing the new values as props to the controlled component.
Uncontrolled Component: stores its own state internally, and you query the DOM using a ref to find its current value when you need it. This is a bit more like traditional HTML.
