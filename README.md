##### Imperative/Declarative
Imperative approach is giving step by step instruction on how to get to the end state, while declarative approach is just giving the end result and React does all the steps to get there. 

##### Programming Paradigms
Procedural, Functional, Object Oriented, Component Oriented. Even though javascript has callbacks it is not function because functional programming also has immutable data and a focus on recursion over looping.
